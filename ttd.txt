Things to do:

* Dr. Gretchen shouldn't have been copied over, and she shouldn't have had her RR line triplicated.
   --- fix the triplicate first, then the fact that it was copied.

* Make this entry the template.

* Modifying the text doesn't work anymore.

* Remove repeated lines

1. Version numbering.

1. Modify libsbook to work with either STL strings or QStrings.
   (Compile-time #ifdef)

2. Modify sbookqt to work with new libsbook.

3. Modify SBook5 so that the Person and PersonList structures start using the functionality  
   inside libsbook, and then slowly migrate functions from Objective-C to C++.

4. Option to avoid synching private entries.
