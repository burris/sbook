BUGS:
*Henry N. Hotlzman - second word comes up as "Holtzman"
when you delete an entry, displayedEntry doesn't get changed to the new displaydEntry.
* editing on the first line doesn't set isdirty

* Need to reparse before printing.
* WHen you delete an entry, and display a new one, need to select the new one.
* double-click in text should select it. 
* Need displayedEntry, in addition to selectedEntry
FILE LOCKING:
  * before you can make a file dirty, needs to grab a write lock. file.lck
RECORD LOCKING:
  * file.lck contains the number of the record you are locking and your name.
FAST SAVES:
  * after the entires, file has delta entries with new versions or deletions.
    Find last </entries> and overwrite it.    
* autosave if file has not been modified for 30 seconds.
* If you click and drag, move the focus back down to the text field
* when you do a full-text search, it should scroll to the search field and hilight it.
* autosave
* file locking
* delete an entry, it should say how many entries left.
* delete entry, new selected entry should be hilighted
* If you click at the end of the first line, and hit return, it should insert a blank line. So note if the last event was a keystorke or a click, and act accordingly.

* Grab a read/write lock on the file.
* replace QString with a CBuffer object in xml.cpp, which should dramatically improve loading time.
* initials
* Autosave
* dirty/not dirty should be kept track of in the EntryList?

  lazy evaluation (necessary for client/server system)

Short-term things:
* drag & drop of entries
* figure out what is wrong with SBook on a \\ share 
* right-click on the name in the list should bring up menu of options.

Things that need to be done:
* Import of tab-delimited and CSV inputs.
* Export of tab-delimited and CVS outputs.

   => Avoid going to multiple-windows.
* Printing Address Books
* Printing envelopes
* Bulk email
* Rule-based dialing system.
