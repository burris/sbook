Distributed theory of operation:

REPLICATION
  SBook is based no a replication system that's similar to what's used
  by the Microsoft Briefcase or IMAP.  By design, the server is a
  simple SQL server that you have access to. (It could be a more
  sophisticated application based server.)

  Database is created with a "publish" command. This does the
  following:
	=> Requests admin username/password
	=> Creates schema on remote system.
	=> Uploads the copy of the database from the local file.

  The SQL database consists of the following:
        => List of entries, with the following:
	   - mod time
	   - XML for entry itself.
	   - bit for deleted.

  Once a database exists, you can create a replicant database. A
  replicant contains the following information:

	=> SQL server source.
	=> Username/password
	=> Time of last update.
	=> Local copies of each record, along with a bit that
	indicates if it has been modified and another bit that
	indicates if it has been deleted.
