1) Freeform address listing -

2) phone number searching - should be able to enter phone numbers in
multiple formats, search for them in
any of the formats and match any other
    (Otherwise, different people entering numbers must use the same format
or they won't be able to find it.)

I think the easiest way to do that is to ignore space, dot, paren, comma
when matching numeric searches -
that way, it's pretty international already.

If you entered 555-1233 and 555.1234, and entered "555123", it should show
both listings as possibilites.

3) "and", "or", and "not" searching

4) Version history of changes to entries
    - changes can have comments (A la cvs)
    - changes dated
    - tags?

5) Clickable email addresses and hyperlinks (username@something.something,
http://www.monkey.com)
    (Should just www.monkey.com work?  Outlook makes it work, but that may
be too silly.)

    Handle linewrapping and URL-ification correctly, which no one else does.

6) Import/export in .wab and vcard format

7) Some people like phone dialing - it's easy, it could be done

8) Would be nice - maintenance of

9) Multiple books
    - display one book at a time, multiple books, all books
    - text search in one to all books

10) Interoperability between web & localhost based sbook
    some books local
    some books remote
    one URL can contain multiple books (?) - probably not worth it
    want to be able to subscribe or unsubscribe to a booklist
    server should know who has read & write permission to books
    "moderated" books - can submit changes which must be
approved/disapproved by moderator

11) Crypto
    crypt some info
    crypt all info - checkbox (encrypted, unencrypted)
    If you crypt a note, crypt the version history
    crypt some notes? (cleartext notes, encrypted note - probably too
complicated)
    Warn before unencrypting entries
    Optional Default - encrypt new entries
    SSL-based communication between webbook and sbook
