<title>SBook 5.0 Changes</title>

<h1>SBook 5.1 Changes</h1>
<h2>Changes for Version 5.1.007 (August, 2004)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed export of AIM when line was in the form:<br>
<blockquote>
<pre>
aim: myaimusername
</pre>
or:
<pre>
myaimusername (AIM)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<li>Fixed bug where new entries were not being copied to AddressBook on sync or export.
<li>Fixed alert bug where loading an XML file generated a warning that the "sbookversion" tag was unknown.
</ul>
<h2>Changes for Beta 2 (July 2004)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Importing an SBookXML file now does a merge --- the most recent record remains and the older record vanishes. 
<li>Export to a File works, with Range panel. (Welcome back, Range panel!) This means that you can export, for example, all of the entries modified since last week.
<li>All places where ASCII is read or written now accept UTF-8 instead.
<li>Export format is now a modified vCard. (It's a vcard with an X-IMAGE2: field that has a compressed copy of the full SBook record.)
</ul>

<h1>SBook 5.0 Changes</h1>

<h2>Changes for Version 5.20.001 (November, 2004)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Changed version number to avoid function with SBook 5.18.
<li>Corrected typo in "Doing more with SBook" help.
</ul>

<h2>Changes for Version 5.1.010 (November, 2004)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed dropping of addresses on sync with Apple AddressBook. Now addresses are copied.
<li>Fixed automatic removal of tabs in entries; they are now preserved.
<li>Removed plug-ins from Resources directory and moved them to a Plug-ins directory.
</ul>

<h2>Changes for Version 5.1.0 (November, 2003)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed drag-and-drop within SBookText area. (You can now drag from one part of area to another).
<li>Split SBook5 into multiple bundles which are dynamcially loaded at run time.
<li>The tab key in the search field now takes the cursor to the SBookText area.
<li>The option-tab key in the SBookText area takes you to the search field.
<li>(As always, arrows in the search field move the selected record up and down.)
<li>Alt-return in search field now works as up arrow to select previous entry.
<li>shift-click on "@" icon no longer puts in HTML escape stuff necessary for mailto: URLs.
<li>Found a really nasty bug that caused crashes when too many files were opened and closed. I'm glad we got rid of it!
<li>Fixed minor bugs in the company parser. "Utilities" is now a pro-company keyword.

<li>Dramatically improved synchronization with Apple
AddressBook. Entry categories are now properly preserved, even when
Apple-special labels are used. (Apple's stuff is not documented and
has required a significant amount of reverse engineering.) Took care
of several cases that resulted in duplicate data. Dramatically
improved performance. But be careful! It can sometimes delete SBook entries. <b>Always keep a backup copy.</b>

</ul>


<h2>Changes for Version 5.18 (November, 2003)</h2> <ul> <li>Added
license agreement.  <li>Fixed bug with AddressBook in which names were
not being printed between entries.  <li>Fixed bug with Services in
which SBook's window wasn't coming forward after a Services
request. (Actually, I coded around a bug in Apple's AppKit.)  </ul>
<h2>Changes for Version 5.17 (November, 2003)</h2> <ul> <li>Further
improvements to Sync; you can now cancel a sync while it is happening.
<li>Initial work on remote sync to SBook server.  <li>Finally fixed
bug where modem was not being released after XX minutes, even though
preference to do so was set.  <li>Clicking on email @-sign now sends
both name and e-mail address to Mail.app.  <li>You can override
SBook's Person/Company decision by control-clicking on person/company
icon.  <li>Subtle improvements to parser.  <li>Improvements to
Preferences panel.  <li>SBook now comes with a license agreement.
<li>You can now push a single entry to the Apple AddressBook <li>New
option to remove all space at the beginning of each line.  </ul>

<h2>Changes for Version 5.16 (November, 2003)</h2>
<ul>
<li>SBook now requires 10.3. You've been warned.
<li>Support for 10.3 address book features on sync (noting that something is a company).
<li>SBook no longer identifies a phone number as a company on sync if the phone number is on the second line of the entry.
<li>Envelope View now properly takes return address front from return address font well.
<li>Preferences panel cleaned up.
<li>File export panel cleaned up.
<li>Apply Template now clears background color and margins.
